Stage 1: Problem Definition and Data Scoping
First, you must define a clear business problem or question. This could be anything from
predicting customer churn for a subscription service to analysing sales patterns in a retail
dataset or segmenting customers for a marketing campaign. You must then find a suitable,
publicly available dataset that can be used to address this problem.

You should justify both your problem choice and your dataset selection, explaining why the
problem is relevant from a business perspective and how the dataset is appropriate for your
analysis.
