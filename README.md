Stage 1: Problem Definition and Data Scoping
First, you must define a clear business problem or question. This could be anything from
predicting customer churn for a subscription service to analysing sales patterns in a retail
dataset or segmenting customers for a marketing campaign. You must then find a suitable,
publicly available dataset that can be used to address this problem.

You should justify both your problem choice and your dataset selection, explaining why the
problem is relevant from a business perspective and how the dataset is appropriate for your
analysis.

Stage 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Pre-processing

Once you have your dataset, you must thoroughly explore, clean, and prepare it for analysis.
This is a critical stage to understand the data’s structure, limitations, and potential.
Key activities include:

1. Summarising the data and analysing its distributions (e.g., using histograms, box plots).
2. Handling missing values, noise, or inconsistencies.
3. Transforming data types (e.g., handling timestamps, encoding categorical data).
4. Using effective data visualisation to uncover initial patterns, correlations, and
outliers. This is a key Business Intelligence skill for communicating complex data clearly.

Stage 3: Data Mining and Business Insights

This is the core of your project. Based on your business problem and the insights from your
EDA, you will apply appropriate data mining or machine learning techniques. The technique
you choose must be justified.

For example, you might:
1. Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) for customer segmentation.
2. Build a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict an
outcome.
3. Apply association rule mining to discover product relationships.
Crucially, you must not only present the technical results. You must translate these results
into meaningful business intelligence. Effective data visualisations are a critical tool for this
translation process, helping to tell a clear story to stakeholders.

Stage 4: Evaluation, Recommendations, and Critical Reflection

Finally, you must evaluate your work and reflect on its wider implications. This involves three
aspects:

1. Technical Evaluation: Assess the performance of your model or analysis using
appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall for a classifier; silhouette score for
clustering). Justify your choice of metrics.
2. Business Evaluation: Critically reflect on the business value and limitations of your
solution. Conclude with a clear set of actionable recommendations for the organisation.
For instance, what is the potential return on investment? What are the risks? What should
the next steps be?
3. Ethical, Security, and Privacy Evaluation: Critically reflect on the wider
implications of your project. Your discussion must be specific to your chosen problem and
dataset. Consider:
  • Ethics and Fairness: Does your dataset or model have the potential for bias (e.g.,
  gender, racial, age)? How might your results lead to unfair outcomes for certain groups?
  How could this be mitigated?
  • Privacy: What are the privacy risks associated with the data? Even if the data is
  “public,” could individuals be re-identified? How should the insights be handled to
  protect privacy?
  • Security: If this system were deployed, what are the key security considerations? Think
  about data storage, access control, and protecting the model from potential attacks.
